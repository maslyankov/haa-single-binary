# haa-single-binary
The awesome HomeKit Accessory Architect (aka HAA and RavenCore v2) firmware for ESP8266 with a single file binary for using with some flashing tools.

# How to use

This repo was created for my article on the [Easiest way to flash your Sonoff, Shelly, Wemos or any ESP8266 and add HomeKit support](https://smarty.one/posts/easiest-way-to-flash-your-sonoff-shelly-wemos-or-any-esp8266)

The three files (rboot.bin, blank_config.bin, haaboot.bin) were combined into **haa-single.bin** using the cat command on MacOS.
